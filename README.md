# CS6910 Project

[2022-01-26]
+ Questions to ask to TA:
  + What is the format of ASR's output ? If we submit a hindi speech will ASR generate the output using roman dialect.
    + Depends on training data !!
+ Domain:
  + Voice search: news, music
    + Social impact:
      + Such technology can be deployed in places where literacy rate in not sufficient. Using such tech, we may be able to provide them access to important news.
    + What is different from youtube audio search ?
      + Youtube audio search may not (verification needed ?) perform well on regional languages.
      + And we will only show verified news videos.
    + Sentences:
      + Tokens: music: general music keyword, news: politics, region specific
  + Complain filing: police complain, muncipality complain
    + Social impact:
      + People with low education level may not know the proper channel to communicate their problems. We can bidge this gap by enabling them in filing complains.
    + App:
      + Jan Sunyai, UP
    + Sentences:
      + Tokens: Crime, complain, police, municipality
      + Word dict: filter words from govt website.
